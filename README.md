# Game Analysis Guidelines
This is a list of general guidelines to analyze a videogame or a specific segment of
it. It can also be helpful to compare different games. This is not a template, but
rather a list of aspects that can be part of your analysis. Every section relates to all
the others; they are listed in an order that would facilitate building up the
argument, but can be rearranged depending on the goal of your analysis. Which
sections you should expand on depends on the focus of your discussion. Whether
you're analyzing a whole game and its context, or your experience of playing the
game, or one specific game mechanic, are all factors that will shape your analysis
